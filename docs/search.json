The present study examines the performance of 190 plasma based analytes in differentiating AD from controls.\n\n\nMethods\nA luminex based multiplex immunoassay panel was utilized in 266 plasma samples from the University of Pennsylvania neurodegeneration and dementia centers. The multiplex panel was utilized to estimate the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating AD from controls. Performance of the panel was compared to a baseline demographic model including age, gender and ApoE4. Expression of final panel analytes was also examined in CSF to test whether these same plasma markers also showed differential expression in CSF. Finally, plasma analytes were examined for relationship to ApoE4 allelic expression.\n\n\nResults\nA demographic model to differentiate AD from controls and including age, gender and ApoE4 genotype showed 64% sensitivity and 73% specificity with a corresponding diagnostic accuracy of 70%. A model using between 18-30 analytes significantly increased specificity to 70-85% when sensitivity was set to 80%. The panel also showed some utility in differentiating AD from other forms of dementia. Performance of the panel is being compared in additional independent datasets. A majority of the analytes were also differentially expressed in CSF suggesting biological relevance to CNS pathology. Finally, Apolipoprotein E protein levels in plasma were lower in patients with one or more ApoE4 alleles compared to those with no ApoE4 alleles suggesting there is a specific plasma phenotype associated with ApoE genotype.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiplex plasma panels have utility as screening tools that could be combined with cognitive, imaging or CSF biomarkers to aid in identifying patients with AD."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent years have seen a resurgence in drug discovery efforts aimed at the identification of covalent inhibitors which has led to an explosion of literature reports in this area and most importantly new approved therapies. These reports and breakthroughs highlight the significant investments made across the industry in SAR campaigns to optimize inhibitors. The potency of covalent inhibitors is generally considered to be more accurately described by the time-independent kinetic parameter kinact/Ki rather than a by a simple IC50 since the latter is a time-dependent parameter. Enzyme substrate concentrations are an additional important factor to consider when attempting to translate parameters derived from enzymology experiments to phenotypic behavior in a physiologically relevant cell-based system. Theoretical and experimental investigations into the relationship between IC50, time, substrate concentration and Kinact/Ki provided us with an effective approach to provide meaningful data for SAR optimization. The data we generated for our JAK3 irreversible covalent inhibitor program using IC50 values provided by enzyme assays with long incubations (&gt;1h) coupled with physiological substrate concentration provided the medicinal chemist with optimal information in a rapid and efficient manner. We further document the wide applicability of this method by applying it to other enzymes systems where we have run covalent inhibitor programs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDysregulation of ceramide synthesis has been associated with metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. We examined the changes in lipid homeostasis and gene expression in Huh7 hepatocytes when the synthesis of ceramide is perturbed by knocking down serine pal mitoyltransferase subunits 1, 2, and 3 (SPTLC123) or dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DEGS1). Although knocking down all SPTLC subunits is necessary to reduce total ceramides significantly, depleting DEGS1 is sufficient to produce a similar outcome. Lipidomic analysis of distribution and speciation of multiple lipid classes indicates an increase in phospholipids in SPTLC123-silenced cells, whereas DEGS1 depletion leads to the accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates, free fatty acids, and diacylglycerol. When cer amide synthesis is disrupted, the transcriptional profiles indicate inhibition in biosynthetic processes, downregulation of genes involved in general endomembrane traffi cking, and upregulation of endocytosis and endosomal recycling. SPTLC123 silencing strongly affects the expression of genes involved with lipid metabolism. Changes in amino acid, sugar, and nucleotide metabolism, as well as vesicle trafficking between organelles, are more prominent in DEGS1-silenced cells. These studies are the first to provide a direct and comprehensive understanding at the lipidomic and transcriptomic levels of how Huh7 hepatocytes respond to changes in the inhibition of ceramide synthesis."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: The BD ProbeTec™ ET System is based on isothermal strand displacement amplification (SDA) of target nucleic acid coupled with homogeneous real-time detection using fluorescent probes. We have developed a novel, rapid method using this platform that incorporates a universal detection format for identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genotypic variations.\nMethod: The system uses a common pair of fluorescent Detector Probes in conjunction with unlabeled allele-specific Adapter Primers and a universal buffer chemistry to permit analysis of multiple SNP loci under generic assay conditions. We used Detector Probes labeled with different dyes to facilitate differentiation of two alternative alleles in a single reaction with no postamplification manipulation. We analyzed six SNPs within the human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) gene, using whole blood, buccal swabs, and urine samples, and compared results with those obtained by DNA sequencing.\nResults: Unprocessed whole blood was successfully genotyped with as little as 0.1–1 μL of sample per reaction. All six β2AR assays were able to accommodate ≥20 μL of unprocessed whole blood. For the 14 individuals tested, genotypes determined with the six β2AR assays agreed with DNA sequencing results.\nConclusion: SDA-based allelic differentiation on the BD ProbeTec ET System can detect SNPs rapidly, using whole blood, buccal swabs, or urine."

This text brings together for the first time in a single volume a comprehensive survey of methods important to the nonclinical science areas within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Specifically the Discovery and Translational sciences, the Safety/Toxiology sciences, and the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls sciences. Drug discovery and development is a long and costly process. Most decisions in the drug development process are made with incomplete information. The data is rife with uncertainties and hence risky by nature. This is therefore the purview of Statistics. As such, this book aims to introduce readers to important statistical thinking and its application in thesenonclinical areas. The chapters provide as appropriate, a scientific background to the topic, relevant regulatory guidance, current statistical practice, and further research directions."

    "text": "Abstract\nEvaluating models fit to data with internal spatial structure requires specific cross-validation (CV) approaches, because randomly selecting assessment data may produce assessment sets that are not truly independent of data used to train the model. Many spatial CV methodologies have been proposed to address this by forcing models to extrapolate spatially when predicting the assessment set. However, to date there exists little guidance on which methods yield the most accurate estimates of model performance.\nWe conducted simulations to compare model performance estimates produced by five common CV methods fit to spatially structured data. We found spatial CV approaches generally improved upon resubstitution and V-fold CV estimates, particularly when approaches which combined assessment sets of spatially conjunct observations with spatial exclusion buffers. To facilitate use of these techniques, we introduce the spatialsample package which provides tooling for performing spatial CV as part of the broader tidymodels modeling framework."

We compared several analysis methods, both univariate and multivariate, on the basis of empirical power and provide an illustrative example of data from a controlled clinical trial. Simulated viral load data demonstrate that methods adjusting for baseline data have power increasing with increasing positive intrasubject correlation expected with this type of data. Several summary measures considered have power compatible with multivariate tests."

The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples, and every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process.\nThis multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner’s reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book’s R package.\nThis text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics."

The use of plasma biomarkers improved specificity in differentiating patients with AD from controls, and ApoE plasma levels were lowest in patients whose mild cognitive impairment had progressed to dementia.\n\n\nConclusions\nPlasma biomarker results confirm cerebrospinal fluid studies reporting increased levels of pancreatic polypeptide and N-terminal protein B–type brain natriuretic peptide in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. Incorporation of plasma biomarkers yielded high sensitivity with improved specificity, supporting their usefulness as a screening tool. The ApoE genotype was associated with a unique biochemical profile irrespective of diagnosis, highlighting the importance of genotype on blood protein profiles."

The integration of high-dimensional data is particularly important in biomedical sciences, as they can be used to identify biological mechanisms and predict clinical outcomes well in advance of their occurrence. Because of the lack of powerful analytical tools that can be used by the average biomedical researcher, translation of such knowledge has been extremely slow. We have developed an open-source software, SIMON, to facilitate the application of machine learning to high-dimensional biomedical data. In SIMON, analysis is performed using an intuitive graphical user interface and standardized, automated machine learning approach allowing non-technical researchers to identify patterns and extract knowledge from high-dimensional data and build high-quality predictive models."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nGlucagon is an important hormone in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, particularly in the maintenance of euglycemia and prevention of hypoglycemia. In type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), glucagon levels are elevated in both the fasted and postprandial states, which contributes to inappropriate hyperglycemia through excessive hepatic glucose production. Efforts to discover and evaluate glucagon receptor antagonists for the treatment of T2DM have been ongoing for approximately two decades, with the challenge being to identify an agent with appropriate pharmaceutical properties and efficacy relative to potential side effects. We sought to determine the hepatic & systemic consequence of full glucagon receptor antagonism through the study of the glucagon receptor knock-out mouse (Gcgr-/-) compared to wild-type littermates.\n\n\nResults\nLiver transcriptomics was performed using Affymetric expression array profiling, and liver proteomics was performed by iTRAQ global protein analysis. To complement the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we also conducted metabolite profiling (~200 analytes) using mass spectrometry in plasma. Overall, there was excellent concordance (R = 0.88) for changes associated with receptor knock-out between the transcript and protein analysis. Pathway analysis tools were used to map the metabolic processes in liver altered by glucagon receptor ablation, the most notable being significant down-regulation of gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism, and fatty acid oxidation processes, with significant up-regulation of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and cholesterol biosynthetic processes. These changes at the level of the liver were manifested through an altered plasma metabolite profile in the receptor knock-out mice, e.g. decreased glucose and glucose-derived metabolites, and increased amino acids, cholesterol, and bile acid levels.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn sum, the results of this study suggest that the complete ablation of hepatic glucagon receptor function results in major metabolic alterations in the liver, which, while promoting improved glycemic control, may be associated with adverse lipid changes."

Plasma was obtained in the morning following an overnight fast and samples were processed within 120 min of collection. Selection of the AD and NC subset was based on availability of both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid imaging data. In addition, selection of NC was based upon CSF ABeta42 levels above the median distribution for NC. Analytes with more than 10% missing data were excluded from the analysis and raw data were normalized with missing and outlier data imputed. Group comparisons for each analyte were adjusted for age, gender and ApoE allele status. Multivariate analyses were completed to assess multiple discriminatory potential between AD subjects, MCI subjects at risk of progressing, and NC.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 190 analytes, 146 passed quality control criteria. Abnormalities were observed in both AD and MCI groups in a number of apolipoproteins (e.g. ApoE), acute phase proteins (e.g. alpha-1 microglobulin), pancreatic enzymes (e.g. pancreatic polypeptide) and cardiovascular/inflammatory markers (e.g. brain natriuretic peptide, Tenascin C). In addition, ApoE and CRP plasma levels were highest in ApoE2/E2 and lowest in E4/E4 subjects, irrespective of diagnosis. A subset of cytokines were also elevated in E4 homozygotes suggesting a plasma based phenotype for ApoE allelic status.\n\n\nConclusions\nAnalysis of plasma patterns in the ADNI cohort suggests some abnormalities in apolipoprotein, inflammatory markers, and pancreatic-metabolic profiles in AD subjects and in subjects at risk of progressing to dementia. Phenotypic blood based patterns were also noted based upon ApoE allele status, suggesting an endophenotype for ApoE. In summary, plasma signatures can provide insight into the heterogeneity underlying AD pathology and may serve as a screening tool for identifying subjects in early stages of the disease."

This article proposes an approach to doing a ridge analysis for optimizing a response surface in the presence of noise variables. We extend the ridge analysis method of Peterson to include some of the factors as noise variables. This approach allows an investigator to explore factor combinations that lower the mean squared error about a target value, while at the same time keeping track of how much the mean response differs from the target value. It also allows an investigator to compute a simultaneous confidence band about the root mean squared error about a target value. This provides a guidance band to aid in determining optimal levels of operation. A variety of factor constraints can be imposed, including those found in mixture experiments. In addition, we propose a modification of our approach that can be used for “larger is better” or “smaller is better” experiments. We illustrate the proposed method using two examples, one of which is a mixture experiment."

The common tactic for setting these parameters is to use resampling methods, such as cross-validation or the bootstrap, to evaluate a candidate set of values and choose the best based on some pre-defined criterion. Unfortunately, this process can be time consuming. However, the model tuning process can be streamlined by adaptively resampling candidate values so that settings that are clearly sub-optimal can be discarded. The notion of futility analysis is introduced in this context. An example is shown that illustrates how adaptive resampling can be used to reduce training time. Simulation studies are used to understand how the potential speed-up is affected by parallel processing techniques."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nMany forms of synaptic plasticity are critically dependent upon production of cGMP to trigger activity-dependent increases in synaptic size and strength. Phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) is a high affinity, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase with widespread distribution in the central nervous system. Inhibition of PDE9A results in significant accumulation of cGMP in brain tissue and CSF of rodents and also increases CSF cGMP in human volunteers (Schmidt et al., 2009 ICAD; Nicholas et al 2009 ICAD). We hypothesize that chronic exposure to a PDE9 inhibitor, and the associated elevations in brain cGMP could provide a therapeutic benefit to vulnerable synapses chronically exposed to Abeta in transgenic amyloid overexpressing mice.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of N = 20 animals per group of 4 month old Tg2576+ and non-transgenic animals were implanted with Alzet osmotic minipumps to deliver vehicle or the PDE9A inhibitor PF-4447943, currently in clinical trials for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease. Neurobehavioral outcomes were measured as conditioned fear response after 30 days of treatment and subsequently the brains were harvested for measurement of Abeta, gene expression profiling or synaptic density as assessed by Golgi staining of dendrites.\n\n\nResults\nDendritic spine density on apical dendrites of CA1 neurons exhibited a small but significant deficit in the density of dendritic spines in vehicle treated transgenic animals as compared to non-transgenic animals. This deficit was ameliorated by 30 days of exposure to PF-04447943. No significant drug effect was observed in the non-transgenic animals. No significant effects of drug treatment were observed on Abeta levels in Tg2576 mice. Behavioral analysis of transgenic animals showed deficits in fear conditioning as early as 2 months of age, and therefore were considered unlikely to be due to the accumulation of oligomeric Abeta. These deficits were not affected by drug treatment. Transcriptional profiles of animals treated with drug compared to vehicle showed evidence of regulation of pathways related to synaptic plasticity and remodeling of the dendritic cytoskeleton, consistent with stabilization of vulnerable spine structure.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis data supports the hypothesis that PDE9 inhibition can stabilize vulnerable synapses early in the Alzheimer’s disease process."

This trend could be encapsulated in this simple formula: D = S * F, where the volume of data generated (D) increases in both dimensions: the number of samples (S) and the number of sample features (F). Frequently, a typical omics classification includes redundant and irrelevant features (e.g. genes or proteins) that can result in long computation times; decrease of the model performance and the selection of suboptimal features (genes and proteins) after the classification/regression step. Multiple algorithms and reviews has been published to describe all the existing methods for feature selection, their strengths and weakness. However, the selection of the correct FS algorithm and strategy constitutes an enormous challenge. Despite the number and diversity of algorithms available, the proper choice of an approach for facing a specific problem often falls in a ‘grey zone’. In this study, we select a subset of FS methods to develop an efficient workflow and an R package for bioinformatics machine learning problems. We cover relevant issues concerning FS, ranging from domain’s problems to algorithm solutions and computational tools. Finally, we use seven different proteomics and gene expression datasets to evaluate the workflow and guide the FS process."

Analytes with more than 10% missing data were excluded from the analysis; raw data were normalized with missing and outlier data imputed.

Both AD and MCI groups showed changes relative to HC for some analytes after controlling for age, gender and ApoE4 status. Four analytes were significantly increased across groups at p &lt; 0.01 (ANCOVA): Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABP), Pancreatic Polypeptide (PPP), Prolactin (PRL), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). In addition, CD40 antigen (P &lt; 0.01), Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA-19-9) (P &lt;0.02) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) (P &lt;0.01) were significantly decreased in AD vs HC.

PRL has been implicated in published reports, however, the current study suggests a stronger relationship. Decreases in CA-19-9 and CD40 antigen have not been previously reported in CSF of AD vs HC, and interestingly were not observed in MCI vs HC. No other significant differences were observed in the wider range of measured peptides that hypothetically might have been altered in a neurotoxic process accompanied by inflammation. Notably, we found a major influence of age (even within a relatively narrow range of 56 - 90 years of age) and/or gender on many analytes. These findings both extend our knowledge of disease associated alterations in AD, and reinforce the importance of accounting for age, gender and genotype before attributing differences to a clinical diagnosis."

To identify novel CSF biomarkers that distinguish pathologically confirmed AD from cognitively normal subjects and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders, we collected antemortem CSF samples from 66 AD patients and 25 patients with other neurodegenerative dementias followed longitudinally to neuropathologic confirmation, plus CSF from 33 cognitively normal subjects. We measured levels of 151 novel analytes via a targeted multiplex panel enriched in cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, as well as established AD CSF biomarkers (levels of Aβ42, tau and p-tau181). Two categories of biomarkers were identified: (1) analytes that specifically distinguished AD (especially CSF Aβ42 levels) from cognitively normal subjects and other disorders; and (2) analytes altered in multiple diseases (NrCAM, PDGF, C3, IL-1α), but not in cognitively normal subjects. A multi-prong analytical approach showed AD patients were best distinguished from non-AD cases (including cognitively normal subjects and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders) by a combination of traditional AD biomarkers and novel multiplex biomarkers. Six novel biomarkers (C3, CgA, IL-1α, I-309, NrCAM and VEGF) were correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment at CSF collection, and altered levels of IL-1α and TECK associated with subsequent cognitive decline in 38 longitudinally followed subjects with mild cognitive impairment. In summary, our targeted proteomic screen revealed novel CSF biomarkers that can improve the distinction between AD and non-AD cases by established biomarkers alone."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nClinicopathological studies suggest that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology begins ∼10–15 years before the resulting cognitive impairment draws medical attention. Biomarkers that can detect AD pathology in its early stages and predict dementia onset would, therefore, be invaluable for patient care and efficient clinical trial design. We utilized a targeted proteomics approach to discover novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that can augment the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of current leading CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, tau, p-tau181).\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing a multiplexed Luminex platform, 190 analytes were measured in 333 CSF samples from cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0), very mildly demented (CDR 0.5), and mildly demented (CDR 1) individuals. Mean levels of 37 analytes (12 after Bonferroni correction) were found to differ between CDR 0 and CDR&gt;0 groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that small combinations of a subset of these markers (cystatin C, VEGF, TRAIL-R3, PAI-1, PP, NT-proBNP, MMP-10, MIF, GRO-α, fibrinogen, FAS, eotaxin-3) enhanced the ability of the best-performing established CSF biomarker, the tau/Aβ42 ratio, to discriminate CDR&gt;0 from CDR 0 individuals. Multiple machine learning algorithms likewise showed that the novel biomarker panels improved the diagnostic performance of the current leading biomarkers. Importantly, most of the markers that best discriminated CDR 0 from CDR&gt;0 individuals in the more targeted ROC analyses were also identified as top predictors in the machine learning models, reconfirming their potential as biomarkers for early-stage AD. Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that an optimal panel of markers for predicting risk of developing cognitive impairment (CDR 0 to CDR&gt;0 conversion) consisted of calbindin, Aβ42, and age.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nUsing a targeted proteomic screen, we identified novel candidate biomarkers that complement the best current CSF biomarkers for distinguishing very mildly/mildly demented from cognitively normal individuals. Additionally, we identified a novel biomarker (calbindin) with significant prognostic potential."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nBiomarkers have significantly improved the clinical prediction of underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in patients with memory impairment, but no reliable blood test is available for the diagnosis of AD. Currently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) peptides related to AD represent the most promising biomarkers to predict underlying AD pathology, although a blood-based screening algorithm may be useful to identify those with abnormal CSF AD biomarker profiles. Here we present the cross-sectional plasma mutli-analyte profiles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD from two independent centers and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiatve (ANDI).\n\n\nMethods\n600 subjects with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia (including AD and non-AD dementias) were recruited from University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) and Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Levels of 189 plasma analytes were measured in these subjects. Plasma analytes associated with MCI and AD were identified in each center’s cohort, and candidate plasma biomarkers common to both datasets were validated in the ADNI cohort selected for plasma multi-analyte profiling.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen plasma analytes were found to be associated with the clinical diagnosis of MCI/AD in both cohorts, including apolipoprotein E, inflammatory proteins, and neuropeptides. Six of these seventeen analytes also showed altered levels in non-AD dementias (including frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies), with five analytes showing the same type of changes as AD. When all candidate plasma AD biomarkers were examined in ADNI subjects, alterations in three analytes were strongly associated with the clinical diagnosis of MCI/AD and decreased CSF Abeta42 levels after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlterations in some plasma analytes may be useful in the prediction of MCI, AD, or decreased CSF Abeta42 levels in subjects suspected of having cognitive impairment associated with AD. Plasma analytes identified to be predictive of MCI and AD may differ between independent cohorts due to variations in patient characteristics, risk factors for disease, and sample handling."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nInhibition of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) promotes cyclic nucleotide signaling, increases striatal activation, and decreases behavioral activity. Enhanced cyclic nucleotide signaling is a well established route to producing changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that chronic suppression of PDE10A activity would have significant effects on gene expression in the striatum. A comparison of the expression profile of PDE10A knockout (KO) mice and wild-type mice after chronic PDE10A inhibition revealed altered expression of 19 overlapping genes with few significant changes outside the striatum or after administration of a PDE10A inhibitor to KO animals. Chronic inhibition of PDE10A produced up-regulation of mRNAs encoding genes that included prodynorphin, synaptotagmin10, phosphodiesterase 1C, glutamate decarboxylase 1, and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase and a down-regulation of mRNAs encoding choline acetyltransferase and Kv1.6, suggesting long-term suppression of the PDE10A enzyme is consistent with altered striatal excitability and potential utility as a antipsychotic therapy. In addition, up-regulation of mRNAs encoding histone 3 (H3) and down-regulation of histone deacetylase 4, follistatin, and claspin mRNAs suggests activation of molecular cascades capable of neuroprotection. We used lentiviral delivery of cAMP response element (CRE)-luciferase reporter constructs into the striatum and live animal imaging of 2-{4-[-pyridin-4-yl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]-phenoxymethyl}-quinoline succinic acid (TP-10)-induced luciferase activity to further demonstrate PDE10 inhibition results in CRE-mediated transcription. Consistent with potential neuroprotective cascades, we also demonstrate phosphorylation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 and H3 in vivo after TP-10 treatment. The observed changes in signaling and gene expression are predicted to provide neuroprotective effects in models of Huntington’s disease."

We sought to develop an in vitro assay that would predict reproductive toxicity and be high throughput in nature. H295R cells, previously validated as having an intact and functional steroidogenic pathway, were treated with 83 known-positive and 79 known-negative proprietary and public-domain compounds. The assay measured the expression of the key enzymes STAR, 3βHSD2, CYP17A1, CYP11B2, CYP19A1, CYP21A2, and CYP11A1 and the hormones DHEA, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol. We found that a Random Forest model yielded a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.845, with sensitivity of 0.724 and specificity of 0.758 for predicting in vivo reproductive toxicity with this in vitro assay system."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nWe utilized a multiplex panel to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ADNI cohort. These results were compared to reported plasma peptide values for the same ADNI subjects.\n\n\nMethods\nCSF baseline ADNI samples (327) were assessed in a multiplex luminex assay (N = 92 HC, N = 69 AD, N = 149 amnestic MCI, N = 1 unknown diagnosis, plus 16 technical replicates). Plasma peptide values for these same ADNI subjects were previously reported using the same multiplex assay (Soares et al., AAIC, 2011, manuscript submitted). Analytes with &gt;10% missing data were excluded from the analysis; raw data were normalized with missing and outlier data imputed. Group comparisons for each analyte were adjusted for age, gender and ApoE genotype.\n\n\nResults\nUsing a &gt;0.45 Spearman Rank Correlation value as a threshold for a modest or greater degree of covariance, 14 out of 75 analytes co-varied across CSF and plasma using the actual reported concentrations. When adjusted for age, gender and APOE4 status 71% peptides maintained a correlation &gt;0.45. Five peptides correlated with values from 0.89-0.64, in order from highest to lowest: leptin, C-Reactive Protein, apolipoprotein (a), immunoglobulin A, chemokine CC-4 and pancreatic polypeptide.\n\n\nConclusions\nMost peptides showed little correlative relationship between CSF and plasma in this cross-sectional group comparison. If steady-state equilibrium across the blood brain barrier were operable, more robust positive correlations for the bulk of the peptides might have been expected. Whether there is a stronger within individual co-variation of peptides over time between these compartments remains open. Functional polymorphisms for the genes of the two peptides showing the highest correlations, leptin and C-reactive protein, have been reported to explain a substantial proportion of the variance in plasma concentrations of their respective protein products. This supports the possibility that common determinants of rates of formation of a limited number of analytes are operable in both compartments."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThere are a wide variety of ligand binding assay platforms available for implementation in present day bioanalytical laboratories. Selecting the platform that best suits a particular project’s needs is highly dependent upon multiple assay characteristics. The active form of glucagon-like protein (GLP-1) is a biomarker of interest for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and therefore a common target for quantitation. Previous projects requiring active GLP-1 measurements involved the use of a labor intensive ELISA, spurring an investigation towards other potential assay platforms. To that end, four separate ligand binding assay formats (standard ELISA, electrochemiluminescence, Gyrolab, and Singulex) were evaluated. The platforms were compared for numerous assay parameters including dynamic range, sample volume requirements, throughput, and cost. Additionally, thirty individual donor plasmas were run with each assay as representative study samples. Although our evaluation did not show any platform that was better than others in all assay characteristics, there was one that was best in sensitivity (Singulex) and one that was best in throughput and sample volume requirements (Gyrolab). The lack of a technology that was best in all categories underscores the importance of due diligence when selecting an assay platform; there are no silver bullets, and one must take into account what is necessary for project needs and the intended use of the data."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTriglyceride accumulation is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Genetic disruption of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), which catalyzes the final reaction of triglyceride synthesis, confers dramatic resistance to high-fat diet induced obesity. Hence, DGAT1 is considered a potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. However, the molecular events shaping the mechanism of action of DGAT1 pharmacological inhibition have not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigate the metabolic molecular mechanisms induced in response to pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 using a recently developed computational systems biology approach, the Causal Reasoning Engine (CRE). The CRE algorithm utilizes microarray transcriptomic data and causal statements derived from the biomedical literature to infer upstream molecular events driving these transcriptional changes. The inferred upstream events (also called hypotheses) are aggregated into biological models using a set of analytical tools that allow for evaluation and integration of the hypotheses in context of their supporting evidence. In comparison to gene ontology enrichment analysis which pointed to high-level changes in metabolic processes, the CRE results provide detailed molecular hypotheses to explain the measured transcriptional changes. CRE analysis of gene expression changes in high fat habituated rats treated with a potent and selective DGAT1 inhibitor demonstrate that the majority of transcriptomic changes support a metabolic network indicative of reversal of high fat diet effects that includes a number of molecular hypotheses such as PPARG, HNF4A and SREBPs. Finally, the CRE-generated molecular hypotheses from DGAT1 inhibitor treated rats were found to capture the major molecular characteristics of DGAT1 deficient mice, supporting a phenotype of decreased lipid and increased insulin sensitivity."

A statistical method known as bootstrapping was applied to MIC90 raw data to uncover data trends and a metric termed Net Percent Superior (NPS) was developed to capture a strain-by-strain analysis of analogs to enable rank-ordering of similar compounds. We also present novel methods of reporting the data using a variety of visualization techniques. Furthermore, the work was cross-validated using experimental results generated with siderophore-conjugated monocarbam analogs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various parameters and visualization techniques. The methods reported herein have been incorporated in a Scitegic Pipeline Pilot protocol to enable facile, automated generation of MIC90 analyses from experimental raw data to aid prospective medicinal chemistry design as well as retrospective analyses."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nInterventions for T2DM have in part aimed to mimic exercise. Here, we have compared the independent and combined effects of a PPARδ agonist and endurance training mimetic (GW501516) and a myostatin antibody and resistance training mimetic (PF-879) on metabolic and performance outcomes in obese insulin resistant mice.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nMale ob/ob mice were treated for 6 weeks with vehicle, GW501516, PF-879, or GW501516 in combination with PF-879. The effects of the interventions on body composition, glucose homeostasis, glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, exercise capacity and metabolic gene expression were compared at the end of study. GW501516 attenuated body weight and fat mass accumulation and increased the expression of genes of oxidative metabolism. In contrast, PF-879 increased body weight by driving muscle growth and altered the expression of genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Despite their differences, both interventions alone improved glucose homeostasis. Moreover, GW501516 more effectively improved serum lipids, and PF-879 uniquely increased energy expenditure, exercise capacity and adiponectin levels. When combined the robust effects of GW501516 and/or PF-879 on body weight, adiposity, muscle mass, glycemia, serum lipids, energy expenditure and exercise capacity were highly conserved.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThe data, for the first time, demonstrate postnatal inhibition of myostatin not only promotes gains in muscle mass similar to resistance training,but improves metabolic homeostasis. In several instances, these effects were either distinct from or complimentary to those of GW501516. The data further suggest that strategies to increase muscle mass, and not necessarily oxidative capacity, may effectively counter insulin resistance and T2DM."

Here we aim to determine plasma biomarkers associated with AD in 2 independent cohorts and validate the findings in the multicenter Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\n\n\nMethods:\nUsing a targeted proteomic approach, we measured levels of 190 plasma proteins and peptides in 600 participants from 2 independent centers (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and identified 17 analytes associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Four analytes (apoE, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, pancreatic polypeptide) were also found to be altered in clinical MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort (n = 566). Regression analysis showed CSF Aβ42 levels and t-tau/Aβ42 ratios to correlate with the number of APOE4 alleles and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and pancreatic polypeptide.\n\n\nConclusion:\nFour plasma analytes were consistently associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/MCI/AD in 3 independent clinical cohorts. These plasma biomarkers may predict underlying AD through their association with CSF AD biomarkers, and the association between plasma and CSF amyloid biomarkers needs to be confirmed in a prospective study."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nStriatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a brain-specific tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to de-phosphorylate several key neuronal signaling proteins, including kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), FYN, PYK2) and glutamate receptor subunits (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B), glutamate receptor 2 (GLUR2)). Step knock-out mice have increased phosphorylation of these substrates in the brain, with potential functional consequences in synaptic plasticity and cognitive tasks. It is therefore of interest to identify the molecular pathways and downstream transcriptional targets that are impacted by Step knockdown. In the present study, striatal RNA samples from Step wild-type, knock-out and heterozygous mice were hybridized to Affymetrix microarray chips and evaluated for transcriptional changes between genotypes. Pathway analysis highlighted Erk signaling and multiple pathways related to neurotrophin signaling, neuronal development and synaptic transmission. Potential genes of interest identified by microarray were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the cortex and hippocampus, which shared several transcriptional alterations with the striatum. In order to evaluate Step knockdown in an in vitro system, a panel of genes were evaluated using qRT-PCR in rat cortical neurons that were transduced with lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA against Step or a non-targeting control. Our data suggest that Step has a role in the expression of immediate early genes relevant to synaptic plasticity, in both in vitro and in vivo systems."

    "text": "Abstract\nInterleukin 17 is a family of cytokines that play a central role in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-17A has been implicated as a key driver of psoriasis, mediating a chronic cycle of T-cell activation, keratinocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. It has been hypothesized that expression of IL-17A and the related cytokine IL-17F could be used as predictive biomarkers for therapeutic response, though they have been difficult to measure locally or in circulation because of their low abundance. We developed ultrasensitive methods for measuring IL-17A and IL-17F in human serum samples and found that serum from psoriasis patients had higher and a broader range of concentrations of both IL-17 proteins compared to healthy volunteers. We also adapted these methods for tissue biopsies and saw higher concentrations of both IL-17 proteins in psoriatic lesions, but they were undetectable in non-lesional skin from the same patients."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nPurpose\nThis post hoc analysis used 11 predictive models of data from a large observational study in Germany to evaluate potential predictors of achieving at least 50% pain reduction by week 6 after treatment initiation (50% pain response) with pregabalin (150–600 mg/d) in patients with neuropathic pain (NeP).\n\n\nMethods\nThe potential predictors evaluated included baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, such as patient-reported pain severity (0 [no pain] to 10 [worst possible pain]) and pain-related sleep disturbance scores (0 [sleep not impaired] to 10 [severely impaired sleep]) that were collected during clinic visits (baseline and weeks 1, 3, and 6). Baseline characteristics were also evaluated combined with pain change at week 1 or weeks 1 and 3 as potential predictors of end-of-treatment 50% pain response. The 11 predictive models were linear, nonlinear, and tree based, and all predictors in the training dataset were ranked according to their variable importance and normalized to 100%.\n\n\nFindings\nThe training dataset comprised 9187 patients, and the testing dataset had 6114 patients. To adjust for the high imbalance in the responder distribution (75% of patients were 50% responders), which can skew the parameter tuning process, the training set was balanced into sets of 1000 responders and 1000 nonresponders. The predictive modeling approaches that were used produced consistent results. Baseline characteristics alone had fair predictive value (accuracy range, 0.61–0.72; κ range, 0.17–0.30). Baseline predictors combined with pain change at week 1 had moderate predictive value (accuracy, 0.73–0.81; κ range, 0.37–0.49). Baseline predictors with pain change at weeks 1 and 3 had substantial predictive value (accuracy, 0.83–0.89; κ range, 0.54–0.71). When variable importance across the models was estimated, the best predictor of 50% responder status was pain change at week 3 (average importance 100.0%), followed by pain change at week 1 (48.1%), baseline pain score (14.1%), baseline depression (13.9%), and using pregabalin as a monotherapy (11.7%).\n\n\nImplications\nThe finding that pain changes by week 1 or weeks 1 and 3 are the best predictors of pregabalin response at 6 weeks suggests that adhering to a pregabalin medication regimen is important for an optimal end-of-treatment outcome. Regarding baseline predictors alone, considerable published evidence supports the importance of high baseline pain score and presence of depression as factors that can affect treatment response. Future research would be required to elucidate why using pregabalin as a monotherapy also had more than a 10% variable importance as a potential predictor."

    "text": "Abstract\nStrategic replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms with fluorine atom(s) is a common tactic to improve potency at a given target and/or to modulate parameters such as metabolic stability and pKa. Molecular weight (MW) is a key parameter in design, and incorporation of fluorine is associated with a disproportionate increase in MW considering the van der Waals radius of fluorine versus hydrogen. Herein we examine a large compound data set to understand the effect of introducing fluorine on the risk of encountering P-glycoprotein mediated efflux (as measured by MDR efflux ratio), passive permeability, lipophilicity, and metabolic stability. Statistical modeling of the MDR ER data demonstrated that an increase in MW as a result of introducing fluorine atoms does not lead to higher risk of P-gp mediated efflux. Fluorine-corrected molecular weight (MWFC), where the molecular weight of fluorine has been subtracted, was found to be a more relevant descriptor."

    "text": "Abstract\nHyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The rTg4510 transgenic mouse model expresses a human variant of tau, P301L, which is repressible with doxycycline. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal loss, and behavioral impairments can be measured in a progressive, age-dependent manner. In this study, we used in vivo volumetric MRI, localized MRS as well as post mortem immunohistochemistry, to evaluate the effects of perinatal tau inhibition. The results demonstrated that continuous doxycycline exposure from birth until adulthood (2.5-month-old) was sufficient to delay accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and formation of NFTs in rTg4510 mouse brain. Volumetric MRI and histological evaluation also highlighted the absence of forebrain atrophy or neurodegeneration until at least 10 months of age. These results suggest that the most severe pathological events associated with P301L tauopathy occur at the perinatal and early postnatal stages and that providing protection against these events may significantly reduce the risks of neurodegeneration in adulthood."

In robust design experiments, settings of design variables that are controllable are sought that are insensitive to the effects of the noise factors. A summary of methods for using confidence statements in the optimization of a product or process during the design phase is given. In addition, confidence regions for determining control factor settings that optimize the mean and variance simultaneously are discussed. An example is used to illustrate the advantages of characterizing the uncertainty in the optimal factor settings."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn the search for novel bile acid (BA) biomarkers of liver organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), cynomolgus monkeys received oral rifampicin (RIF) at four dose levels (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) that generated plasma-free Cmax values (0.06, 0.66, 2.57, and 7.79 µM, respectively) spanning the reported in vitro IC50 values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (≤1.7 μM). As expected, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of an OATP probe drug (i.v. 2H4-pitavastatin, 0.2 mg/kg) was increased 1.2-, 2.4-, 3.8-, and 4.5-fold, respectively. Plasma of RIF-dosed cynomolgus monkeys was subjected to a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method that supported the analysis of 30 different BAs. Monkey urine was profiled, and we also determined that the impact of RIF on BA renal clearance was minimal. Although sulfated BAs comprised only 1% of the plasma BA pool, a robust RIF dose response (maximal ≥50-fold increase in plasma AUC) was observed for the sulfates of five BAs [glycodeoxycholate (GDCA-S), glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA-S), taurochenodeoxycholate, deoxycholate (DCA-S), and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA-S)]. In vitro, RIF (≤100 μM) did not inhibit cynomolgus monkey liver cytosol-catalyzed BA sulfation and cynomolgus monkey hepatocyte-mediated uptake of representative sulfated BAs (GDCA-S, GCDCA-S, DCA-S, and TDCA-S) was sodium-independent and inhibited (≥70%) by RIF (5 μM); uptake of taurocholic acid was sensitive to sodium removal (74% decrease) and relatively refractory to RIF (≤21% inhibition). We concluded that sulfated BAs may serve as sensitive biomarkers of cynomolgus monkey OATPs and that exploration of their utility as circulating human OATP biomarkers is warranted."

Response surface models have been developed to incorporate the effects of variables that have an influence on variance (“noise” and “dispersion} factors) into the design, analysis and interpretation of an experiment. Although there has been a large body of work dealing with normally distributed endpoints, little has been done for non-normal data. Our research focuses on the development of these methodologies for time to response data that are possibly censored, members of the exponential family of distributions which may have nonlinear expectation and variance functions, such as the Poisson and Binomial, and distributions specified only through their first two moments. The development of mean and variance models for responses whose first two moments are nonlinear in the noise factors is accomplished using first and second order Taylor series approximations to the two models. In certain special cases, exact representations of the mean and variance models can be found if fully parametric assumptions are made on the noise factors.\nThe research is illustrated through an example to assess the effect of tumor age on the optimal two drug combination of CTX and 5-FU in combating murine L1210 leukemia. Tumor age, a factor usually unknown at the time of treatment, can cause variation in survival time. Models for both the mean and variance are used to find treatment combinations that are robust to the variation caused by tumor age and yield more consistent treatments, when tumor age is not known. Additional examples involve the modeling of circuit board wafer resistivity, which is typically skewed, the proportion of defective chips on a large scale production circuit board, and the number of bull spermatozoa surviving long term freezing."
