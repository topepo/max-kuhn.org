Hello! I’m a statistician who works at Posit PBC (formerly RStudio), writing R packages for modeling and data analysis. Before this, I worked in research and development in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. 

I’ve written a number of R packages and books, including _Applied Predictive Modeling_, which won the Ziegel award from the American Statistical Association, recognizing the best book reviewed in Technometrics in 2015. We’re writing another book on machine learning called _Applied Machine Learning for Tabular Data_ and you can read that as we write it at [`https://aml4td.org/`](https://aml4td.org/). 

If you need to contact me, try `mxkuhn@gmail.com`.
