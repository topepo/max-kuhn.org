## Abstract

This chapter is a broad overview of the drug discovery process and areas where statistical input can have a key impact. The focus is primarily in a few key areas: target discovery, compound screening/optimization, and the characterization of important properties. Special attention is paid to working with assay data and phenotypic screens. A discussion of important skills for a nonclinical statistician supporting drug discovery concludes the chapter.
